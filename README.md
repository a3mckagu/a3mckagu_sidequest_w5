## Description

Adds a white diving board, 7 randomly situated ducks, 3 randomly situated lifebuoys, and an illustrated pool background.
The playable character is a swan with two spread wings and a beak in a cartoon style that moves ("flies") across the screen upon player input. When it collects lifebuoys it's speed increases
and when it carries a yellow duck, it slows down in speed and the "camera" lagginess/lerp increases.
The player's X and Y move according to WASD key direction input (or arrow keys) to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.
Text instructs users to move and collect ducks (which are small interactive objects for the camera for the camera to discover) on the diving board to win!
Some cautions are provided such as the more ducks you carry, the slower the camera movement and slower the swan moves - evoking an emotion of slight stress and empathetic, caring atmosphere as the player
attempts to save the ducklings!

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Use constrain function to enforce player bounds
- Utilizes classes to separate objects and the environment
- Utilize a JSON file to separate data from logic
- Manipulate lerp() controls to evoke feeling, guide player behaviour, and feeling

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.
Code additions have been made by Andreea McKague but she used GenAI to write the comments
and submitted a Process and Documentation document for transparency and fairness of GenAI code.
